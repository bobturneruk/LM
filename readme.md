# Introduction

*LM* was software written to reconstruct super resolution images from series of diffraction limited images obtained using a modified fluoresence microscope. It has been largely superseeded by many other excellent projects.

The version of the code here is a subset of that held on [https://figshare.shef.ac.uk/articles/LM_Localisation_Microscopy_Matlab/5831208](figshare) in relation to our [https://elifesciences.org/articles/32057](paper) on *Staphylococcus aureus* cell division. My intention is that it makes it easier to navigate the core functionality of the software.

To run the software have a look at this [](vignette).

To read about how it works look at the [](concept of operation).
